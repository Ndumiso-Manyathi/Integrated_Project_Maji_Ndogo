## Answered Queries:

### 1. Which SQL query will produce the date format "DD Month YYYY" from the time_of_record column in the visits table as a single column?

### 2. You are working with an SQL query designed to calculate the Annual Rate of Change (ARC) for basic rural water services. To accomplish this task, what should you use for placeholders (a) and (b) in the query?

### 3. What are the names of the two worst-performing employees who visited the fewest sites, and how many sites did the worst-performing employee visit? Modify your queries from the “Honouring the workers” section.

### 4. If we TRIM() the address '33 Angelique Kidjo Avenue  ' for an employee named Farai Nia, what would be the result?

### 5. How many employees live in Dahabu? Rely on one of the queries we used in the project to answer this.

### 6. How many employees live in Harare, Kilimani?

### 7. On average, how many people share a well? Round your answer to 0 decimals.

### 8. Consider the query we used to calculate the total number of people served. Which line of code will calculate the total number of people using some sort of tap?

### 9. Use the pivot table we created to determine the average queue times for the following times: Saturday from 12:00 to 13:00, Tuesday from 18:00 to 19:00, and Sunday from 09:00 to 10:00.

These SQL queries have been instrumental in extracting specific information, addressing data inconsistencies, and providing insights into various aspects related to the water crisis in Maji Ndogo.
